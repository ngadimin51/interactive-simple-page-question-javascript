# interactive-simple-page-question-javascript
This is sample javascript implementation for Dewa Wahyu's request.  A question page for visitor or maybe student playground. All question store in soal.json Using  sweat alert because the sample Dewa Wahyu's codepen is used that to for popup information. For me? I will consider to sweatalert 2 https://sweetalert2.github.io/  I'm not to much change the library used to and page view.  Just a litle bit customize from me. Perhaps it can help him.  origin : https://codepen.io/dewa-wahyu/pen/QWpYKJW mycustom : https://codepen.io/ngadimin51/pen/oNZmeXB
